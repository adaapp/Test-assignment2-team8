# Tests

## Unit Tests

smoke test - 5+5 = 10 - initial check to see that test are working

there are 2 describe blocks one testing cel to far and one testing far to cel

1. Once we call function check to see if output returns a number

2. Checks function with pre-defined values e.g. 0 Celsius gives 32 Fahrenheit - This test includes 3 assertions

3. Makes sure an error is returned when the function is empty with no input/parameter

4. Makes sure an error is returned when the function is NaN e.g. user has inputted a string

These 4 tests (as described above) are refactored for the next describe block and testing function: Fahrenheit to Celsius
